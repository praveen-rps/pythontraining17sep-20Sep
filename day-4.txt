Access Modifiers
-----------------
Access modifiers provide the visibility of the variables, methods and classes from a package or from a class

1. public

2. private

c or C++
---------
public void display(){
	// statements
}

private void otp(){

// statements;
}


1. public
2. private
3. protected --- Associate only with classes

Exception Handling
-------------------
Two types of errors will occur for a program


1. Compile time errors -- will occur only due to wrong program lang syntax and it 
is easily identified.

2. Runtime time errors -- 

 a, b


a = int(input("Enter a value"))
b = int(input("Enter b value"))
c = a / b
print(c)

The process of handling the run time errors (exceptions) is called exception handling

try:
//we will write all the actual code

except:

// we will the codewhen exception occurs
finally:

// code that is executed mandatorily


try:
	a = int(input("Enter a value"))
	b = int(input("Enter b value"))
	c = a/b
	print(c)
except:
	print("You have entered zero for denonimotr, so please re enter b != 0")
	b = int(input("enter b value"))
	c = a/b
	print(c)
finally:
	print("All done")
	


raise:
------

raise is a keyword which is used to throw an exception without (system defined the condition )
is met

raise is used to explicitly raise the exception without that is actually met

When we want to define the userdefined excpetions

age  = int(input("Enter age of a person"))
print("The person age is ", age)
